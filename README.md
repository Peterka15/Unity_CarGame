I've created this game as a side project for fun. It took me a week to learn basics of Unity and make it.

It is a simple endless-runer for Android Mobile devices. You controll a car, by rotating your smartphone left or right.
Your goal is to go as far as you can, without any crash and colleting coins.

Game is using gyroscope for controlls, and simple user interface with score and distance.
